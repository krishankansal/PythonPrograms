Types of methods:
--------------------
1. instance methods
2. class methods
3. static methods

1. If we are using atleast one instance variable- Instance methods.
2. If we are using only static variables but not instance variable - class methods.
3. If we are not using any instance or static variable - static methods
    static methods are general utility methods.

def m2(cls):
